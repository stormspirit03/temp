css display property 
*block diplay element: some elements has full width for the box ex paragraph , h ,div,ol,ul , li, forms etc we can change width 
but we cant stack them in one line

*inline diplay elements: some has takes only element size  ex img ,span , a mwe can stack them in one line but we cant change their width

##to over come abouve we have 3rd type disply element:
 *inline-block : 
 
 * 4th type is none: we can hide the element without deleting it from html can be used for quiz ans 
 same can be achieved with  visibilty: hidden;  . 




* to decorate part of word or text we can use span tag then modify it ex : Programmer if we want to modify pro 
use it like <p> <span> pro </span>grammer </p>
* to bring blocks in one line we do disaply:inline-blocks

##absolute positioning vs relative positioning:

in absolute it affect other's positions where as in relative positioning it doesnt affect other's positions 
absolute positions according to its closest parent

*fixed is also  type of positioning where it doesnt change position even if we scroll (widly used for header)

font:
caveat

* 100%=16px=1em
when we use % or em  font size  get inherited from parent. where as in px or static it doesnt
insted we can use rem (root em) to avoid the all this.  rem is recommended

* using float we can wrap image around text 
and can use clear to skip float for perticular text , clear left or clear right 
$$$$$ float is most abused property and only use it when necessary to wrap text around any element. dont use it for positionaing
insead use absolute or relative for positioning
